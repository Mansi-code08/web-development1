About  the Web development course 
Thia repository is about the work that i have done in the project . I was new in this web development project so i don't know anything before about web development .
In this summer project i have learned about the HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT .

and how to add images , links , videos and audios in web page .
then coming to the css portion  it is used for the styling the web page .
